# Analyzing Stereotypes in Generative Text Inference Tasks

By: [Anna Sotnikova] `<asotniko@umd.edu>`, [Yang Trista Cao]`<ycao95@umd.edu>`, [Hal Daumé III](http://hal3.name) `<hal3@umd.edu>`, [Rachel Rudinger]`<rudinger@umd.edu>` 

As part of a study of stereotypes in Generative Text Inference Tasks, we collected and annotated a dataset of models generated text inferences for a variety of social groups in the United States. We call this dataset the **StereoInf**; what follows below is the [datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) describing this data. If you use this dataset, please acknowledge it by citing the original paper:

## Motivation


1. **For what purpose was the dataset created?** *(Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.)*
    
    This dataset was created to study stereotypes in masked English language models and measure how stereotypes in models align with human ones. The approach for measuring stereotypes is built on the Agency Beliefs Communion (ABC) model, which measures stereotypes toward a social group with respect to 16 traits in three dimensions: Agency/Socioeconomic Success, Conservative–Progressive Beliefs, and Communion.

1. **Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?**
    
    This dataset was created by Anna Sotnikova, Yang Trista Cao, Hal Daumé III, and Rachel Rudinger. At the time of creation, Cao and Sotnikova were graduate students at the University of Maryland (UMD), and Daumé and Rudinger are Professors there.


1. **Who funded the creation of the dataset?** *(If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.)*
    
    Funding for Cao and Daum\'e III was provided in part from the National Science Foundation project 2131508 and in part from University of Maryland foundation funds. Funding for Sotnikova was provided through the UMD AMSC program.

## Composition


1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?** *(Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.)*
    
    The dataset contains four files: situations, target category and target domains, examples with single annotation, examples with four annotations.

In the Situations file, we provide 103 manually created situations, which can be divided into two groups: underspecified situations and neutral situations.

In the target category and target domain file, we have 71 target categories divided into 6 target domains that are common in the United States.


Examples with single annotation and four annotations contain one or four annotations respectively for the pairs of the permises and the respectie hypotheis.

2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**
    
    In total, we have 2098 annotation. 

3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** *(If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).)*
    
    Our dataset contains all instances (for the details, please, see the paper above).


4. **What data does each instance consist of?** *(``Raw'' data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)or features? In either case, please provide a description.)*
    
    The data is raw.


5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.**
    
    Each example has annotations for 6 questions from our survey, annotator ID, and example ID. <br />
    Q1: Valid? has possible answers: Yes (1) or No (5).<br />
    Q2: Plaus? has possible answers: Yes(1) or No(5).<br />
    Q3: Iden? has possible answers: Yes(1), Maybe yes(2), Not sure(3), Maybe no(4), or No(5).<br />
    Q4: Situ? has possible answers: Yes(1), Maybe yes(2), Not sure(3), Maybe no(4), or No(5).<br />
    Q5: Senti? has possible answers: Positive(1), Maybe positive(2), Neutral(3), Maybe negative(4), or Negative(5).<br />
    Q6: Stereo? has possible answers: Yes(1), Maybe yes(2), Not sure(3), Maybe no(4), or No(5).<br />
    For more details on questions from the survey,please, read the paper.

6. **Is any information missing from individual instances?** *(If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.)*
    
    No.


7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users' movie ratings, social network links)?** *( If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.)*
    
  No. Instances were annotated independently. 

8. **Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?** *(If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.)*
    
    We expect this data to be used for testing purposes.

    We do not explicitly provide a training/validation/testing split;   

9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** *(If so, please provide a description.)*
    
   There are no errors due to data processing. However, one should always keep in mind that all annotations are subjective. 


10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?** *(If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.)*
    
    The dataset is self-contained.


11. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)?** *(If so, please provide a description.)*
    
    No; 

12. **Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?** *(If so, please describe why.)*
    
   Some generated hypothesis might be offensive to certain target categories.

13. **Does the dataset relate to people?** *(If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.)*
    
    Yes, all generations made about certain target categories.

14. **Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)?** *(If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.)*
    
   We collect annotations for 71 target categories.

15. **Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?** *(If so, please describe how.)*
    
    No.


16. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?** *(If so, please provide a description.)*
    
    Some generated hypothesis might be offensive to certain target categories.
